    <h1>About this page</h1>
    <h2>Somerville Community Choice Electricity (CCE) Aggregation</h2>
    <p>The Somerville Community Choice Electricity (CCE) Aggregation began July 2017. See the <a href="https://somervillecce.com">Somerville CCE page</a> for more information.</p>
    
    <h2>This calculator</h2>
    <p>Translating the information on the <a href="https://somervilledev.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/somerville-opt-out-chart-2018.pdf">CCE mailer</a> (TODO: that link is broken) to your bill takes a bit of work. This program aims to achieve stable electricity pricing, increase Somerville’s commitment to local renewable energy, and provide residents an option to opt up to 100% local renewable energy as their source of electricity. This calculator provides an easy way to compare how the options will affect your bill, with a goal of showing that the benefits of 100% local renewable energy can be achieved with a relatively modest increase in a household’s bill.</p>
    <p>To select the Somerville 100% Local Green option, contact Dynegy at <a href="tel:866-220-5696">(866) 220-5696</a>, Monday through Friday from 9AM to 8PM EST, or via email at <a href="mailto:DESCustCare@Dynegy.com">DESCustCare@Dynegy.com</a>. (TODO: is that the right contact info? this was the link that was here before, but it's broken: https://somervillecce.com/how-to-select-the-somerville-100-local-green-option/). You will need your Eversource account number.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, fill out the information in <a href="https://somervillecce.com/opt-up-to-premium-100-local-green/">this form on the Somerville CCE site.</a> (TODO: that link is broken)</p>

    <h2>Calculating an electrical bill</h2>
    <p>A monthly bill is calculated as follows:</p>
    <p><em>kWh * Generation Rate + kWh * Delivery Rate + Customer Charge</em></p>
    <p>The Generation Rate is what is being changed by the CCE plan. By opting up to 100%, only the Generation Rate aspect would increase.</p>
    <p>Delivery Rates are composed of multiple items, see your Eversource bill for details. The delivery rates shown in the calculator by default are from January 2018 for a residential customer.</p>
    <p>For more details on these rates, see the Eversource page on <a href="https://www.eversource.com/Content/ema-c/residential/my-account/billing-payment/understanding-my-bill">Understanding My Electricity Bill</a>. (TODO: that link is broken)</p>
